# Project-1: Safe Music Lovers 


## Welcome to our Project!
My team and I have developed a fully functional web application that allows users to not only view music events/festivals for a desired city but also see real time COVID-19 data for the city as well. Users also have the ability to click on desired event and will be redirected to purchase tickets.
We have also implemented a feature based on what the mortality rate is, a GIF is displayed to the user suggesting to either go to said event or to maybe sit it out. 
What inspired us to develop Safe Music Lovers is the fact that there are millions of people everywhere such as ourselves who love going to events but with this pandemic, the process and overall experience has been all the more difficult.

## How to Use Safe Music Lovers Version 1.0
We made our site user friendly and easy to use. 

Upon loading the page, you will notice a text field in which you are able to search by city. 
After clicking search you will be displayed with music events by various dates as well as with the date, time, and venue location.
You will notice right beside the events are the related COVID-19 data for searched city. Data includes: confirmed cases, deaths, and mortality rate. 
Accompanied with this important data is a dynamically generated GIF suggesting weather or not we think you should go or not along with some text.
If after seeing the data you feel inclined to go, you have the ability to click on the event and be redirected to TicketMaster to purchase your desired ticket amount. 



## Upon closer viewing this application, you will notice: 
A powerful CSS framework, Bootstrap. - Using this framework allowed us to achieve everything we wanted as far as design and aesthetics go. We did this by implementing bootstrap components such as a jumbotron and using preset classes for columns and rows.

An interactive interface. - We made sure our application was user interactive by being able to accept their input and being able to display the necessary and appropriate response. This of course was achieved with the power of Javascript, more specifically, jQuery.

5 server-side APIs at play. -  Our great vision came to life with these APIs: TicketMaster API, GeoCode API, StateInfo API, DiseaseAPI, and GIPHY API

A clean polished UI. - The team's vision was clear, simple is better. You can see how we achieved this by our choice in colors for the page as well as the placement for each individual element, all thought out for simplicity in mind. 

A clean repository. (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).  -  With every project before and after, we strive to make this a mandatory standard.
